# Vonage Video & DeepAR Web SDK Sample

This sample application demonstrates how to use the DeepAR SDK to add face filters and masks to your video call using the [Vonage Video(formerly OpenTok) Web SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/js/).

To run the sample:

1) Sign up at [DeepAR](https://developer.deepar.ai) and create a project.
2) Copy the license key and paste it to `app.js` (instead of your_license_key_here string)
3) Download the DeepAR SDK from https://developer.deepar.ai and copy the deepar.js, deepar.wasm, models-68-extreme.bin and segmentation.zip into deepar folder. Make sure to set libPath and segmentationInfoZip properties during the DeepAR object initialisation (addition from new SDK version)
4) Sign up on https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/video and either create a new project or use an existing project.
5) Go to your project page and scroll down to the Project Tools section. From there, you can generate a session ID and token manually. Use the projectâ€™s API key along with the session ID and token you generated.
6) To quickly test the demo go to https://tokbox.com/developer/tools/playground/ on another device (e.g. desktop) to create a conversation room where you can see the feed from test app:
	- On the playground choose "Create new session"
	- Enter your API key
	- Choose latest JS SDK and leave other options unchanged
	- Click "Create" and on the next screen select Connect
	- Now in your session playground screen select "Publish stream" and "Continue" in the next dialog (you don't need to set any options)
7) In app.js, enter apiKey, sessionId and token
8) Start the development server by running `python server.py` and go to `http://localhost:8888`

## Changing tabs
**Changing tabs will pause** your video stream, because of the underlying usage of a canvas which pauses rendering whenever a tab is changed. If you need continuous video streaming we recommend using a **seperate browser window**, as there is no current workaround for this issue. You can read more in the documentation of the [window.requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) function.
